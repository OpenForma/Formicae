# Formicae: Bridging Forma and Rhino

Formicae is a project born out of the Forma Hackathon, hosted by Autodesk's Forma team at Autodesk's Oslo office on February 13-14, 2024. This project establishes a connection between Forma and Rhino, focusing on the integration of wind prediction analyses into the design process directly to Rhino.

## Features

- **3-Legged Authentication**: Ensures secure access and data exchange between Forma and Rhino, leveraging robust authentication protocols to protect your projects.
- **Streamlined Connectivity**: Facilitates a direct and efficient link from Rhino to Forma and vice versa, simplifying the workflow for architects and designers.
- **Wind Prediction Analysis**: Incorporates advanced wind analysis directly into your design workflow, enabling data-driven decision-making for architectural projects. Note that we are still calibrating the results one gets in Rhino with what Forma gives. The results per such are still not ready. 



## Prerequisites

Before you begin with Fomicae, there are a couple of requirements to ensure a smooth setup and operation:

- **Rhino Installation**: Fomicae is developed as a plugin for Grasshopper, which requires a functioning copy of Rhino. Ensure you have Rhino installed on your system. The plugin is developed for R7. R8 is still not tested.

- **Swiftlet Integration**: For the initial implementation, Fomicae integrates with [Swiftlet](https://www.food4rhino.com/en/app/swiftlet), a tool designed to enhance Grasshopper's capabilities. While Swiftlet is an external dependency at present, we are exploring the possibility of making it a native feature in future developments.

Please ensure these prerequisites are met to fully leverage Fomicae's functionalities.


## Loading Extension

You can use Formicae extension id: "b8b53625-9454-4330-8cee-893098f21803" to add it to your project.


## Contribution

Fomicae is an open-source project, and we welcome contributions from the community. Whether you're a developer, a designer, or an architect, your insights and improvements can help shape the future of Fomicae. We aim to set up a robust guidlines for this as soon as possible.
